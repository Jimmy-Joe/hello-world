Learning the ropes.

Welp. Here we go I guess. I told her humans are very capable, that we can do amazing things if we focus and put our mind to them. Lately I've been cynical of hummanity; it's hard not to be cynical when we live in a society that wages war over religion, elected Donald Trump president, crushes our only platform for real, un-biased, freedom of speech for the benefit of corrupt politicians and greedy corporations, and uses confusion and propaganda to convince the masses things like "climate change is a myth." But I digress, the point is- I'm setting my mind to learning something new, I'll do my best, believe I can be succesful, and I'm looking forward to that! As for the rest of the world, I'll work on that later...
